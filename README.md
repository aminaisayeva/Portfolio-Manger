# Portfolio-Manger

## Added yfinance Example Script

- Created `dummy.py` to demonstrate basic usage of the [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) library
- The script:
  - Imports `yfinance` as `yf`
  - Fetches ticker data for Apple Inc. (`AAPL`)
  - Retrieves the tickerâ€™s info dictionary
  - Prints the available attributes and methods of the ticker object

**Usage:**

1. Ensure `yfinance` is installed:  
   `pip install yfinance`
2. Run the script:  
   `python dummy.py'
